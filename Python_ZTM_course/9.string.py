A string is simply, well, a piece of text.
For example, a string can be written with quotation marks 
"""

"hello" # this is string

'''
inside this quotation, I can do numbers, Exclamation marks if I wanted to.
It's just a piece of text.
'''

print(type("hii... hello there 24!"))

# long string (we can use single or double quotation)
long_string = """
hello

nice to meeting you !

"""


print(long_string)
